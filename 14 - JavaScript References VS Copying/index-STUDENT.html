      // start with strings, numbers and booleans

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      // Only creates reference
      const players_copy = players;
      console.log(`array setter is copy: ${!(players_copy === players)}`);

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      players_from_copy = Array.from(players);
      console.log(
        `array from operation is copy: ${!(players_from_copy === players)}`
      );

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      players_slice_copy = players.slice(0);
      console.log(`array slice is copy: ${!(players_slice_copy === players)}`);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      players_spread_copy = [...players];
      console.log(
        `array spread is copy: ${!(players_spread_copy === players)}`
      );

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      person_ref = person;
      console.log(`object setter is copy: ${!(person_ref === person)}`);

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      person_copy = Object.assign({}, person);
      console.log(`object.assign is copy: ${!(person_copy === person)}`);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      person_spread_copy = { ...person };
      console.log(`object spread is copy: ${!(person_spread_copy === person)}`);

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
